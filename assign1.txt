Assign1: Due 11:59PM June 28

Implement the program mentioned in homework 2. Feel free to change the design based on what you learn moving forward. You don't have to stick to the design created in homework 2, but use that as a starting point.

Take small steps. Write minimum code only to make failing tests pass. Follow short test-code-refactor cycles.

It's generally a good idea to evolve the code based on feedback—create a little, have that reviewed, and then move forward based on the feedback.

Start really early, like right away, that way you'll have opportunity to evolve code based on many reviews.

Initial steps:

 This is the first part of the program. It is only the initial phase not complete. 

1. Our program will take two command line arguments as input for the size of window. Give two integer values one denotes number of rows and other denotes number of columns.
2. It will display the grid according to the size we entered.
3. We can click on the grid and mark as our initial position for  live cell.
4. Cells will turn blue when we click
5. Location will be store in an Arraylist and displayed on cell.
6. After we are done with choosing input locations we click 'play' button to play the game
7. Till now clicking on 'play' button will display a message.
